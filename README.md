# The People Pleaser

This is a game created for the [GMC Jam 36][01], a competition to create a game in 96h according to the theme "Everything has a cost".

Ok, that's cool and all, but what _is_ this game?
This game revolves around a simple concept: You have to please as many people as possible through your interactions.
Each time you play the game a random set of characters will be generated, each with its own likes and dislikes and inter-character relationships.
Throughout the game you interact with several of these characters and in each interaction you have to chose what your behavior will be like.
Depending on your actions some people will like you more while others will like you less.
The goal of the game is by the end of the pre-determined number of interactions to be as friendly as possible with the largest amount of people possible.
